# ðŸŒŠ DockyardMC ðŸš¢

DockyardMC open-source, fast and lightweight Minecraft server protocol implementation that's written from scratch in Kotlin without any code from Mojang. It is focused on making development easy, unlike PaperMC which still uses some really old bukkit APIs, Dockyard has very easy to use and modern API

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is currently under heavy development, and it is NOT production ready.

## Quick Start

You can read how to setup and use dockyard here: https://dockyard.lukynka.cloud/wiki/quick-start

## Features

- Easy to use, modern and extensible API
- Ability to take full control over every aspect of the server
- Lightweight
- uhhh there will be more stuff here later

## API Examples

#### Events

```kotlin
Events.on<PlayerConnectEvent> {
    DockyardServer.broadcastMessage("<lime>â†’ <yellow>${it.player} has joined the server.")
}
```

Modifying events (including PacketReceived and PacketSent)
```kotlin
Events.on<PacketReceivedEvent> {
    if(it.packet is ServerboundPlayerChatMessagePacket) {
        it.packet.message = "ha get overwritten >:3"
    }
}
```
Canceling Events

```kotlin
Events.on<PlayerMoveEvent> {
    // No moving for aso >:3
    if(it.player.username == "AsoDesu_") {
        it.cancelled = true
    }
}
```
---

#### Commands API
You can create commands quickly and easily with the DockyardMC command API

```kotlin
Commands.add("/explode") {
    addArgument("player", PlayerArgument())
    withPermission("player.admin")
    withDescription("executes stuff")
    execute {
        val executingPlayer = it.getPlayerOrThrow()
        val player = getArgument<Player>("player")
    
        player.spawnParticle(player.location, Particles.EXPLOSION_EMITTER, Vector3f(1f), amount = 5)
        player.playSound("minecraft:entity.generic.explode", volume = 2f, pitch = MathUtils.randomFloat(0.6f, 1.3f))
    
        player.sendMessage("<yellow>You got <rainbow><b>totally exploded <yellow>by <red>$executingPlayer")
        executingPlayer.sendMessage("<yellow>You <rainbow><b>totally exploded <yellow>player <red>$player")
    }
}
```

---

#### Periodical Events

Run code periodically
```kotlin
Period.on<HourPeriod> {
    DockyardServer.broadcastMessage("<aqua>Reminder: <yellow>Stay hydrated and stretch once in a while!")
}
```
