DockyardMC open-source, fast and lightweight Minecraft server software that's written from scratch in Kotlin without any code from Mojang. It is focused on making development easy, unlike PaperMC which still uses some really old bukkit APIs, Dockyard has very easy to use and modern API


‚ö†Ô∏è _**This project is currently undear heavy development and it is not even nearly production ready**_


## Features

- Easy to use, modern and extensible API
- Ability to take full control over every aspect of the server
- Lightweight

```kotlin
Events.on<PlayerConnectEvent> {
    DockyardServer.broadcastMessage("<lime>‚Üí <yellow>${it.player} has joined the server.")
}
```

Modifying events (including PacketReceived and PacketSent)
```kotlin

    if(it.packet is ServerboundPlayerChatMessagePacket) {

    }
}
```

    if(it.player.username == "AsoDesu_") {
        it.cancelled = true
    }
}
```

#### Periodical Events

Run code periodically
```kotlin
Period.on<HourPeriod> {
    DockyardServer.broadcastMessage("<aqua>Reminder: <yellow>Stay hydrated and stretch once in a while!")
